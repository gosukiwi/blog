      <p>Welcome to the third part of the PHP MVC tutorial! In the following series
we’ll dig deeper onto MVC, in this part we’ll work on the “M” part of MVC, 
that’s the model!</p>

<p>Most of MVC frameworks come with a nice ORM we can use to abstract the database
from us, taking us one level higher by using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>, remember how C is a low
level programming language and dynamic languages such as PHP are higher level? 
Frameworks provide an even higher level by using several abstractions. </p>

      <p>Hello! And welcome back to the second part of the PHP MVC framework tutorial!
In this part we’ll get our hands dirty with some real code, if you 
haven’t already, you should <a href="http://gosukiwi.github.io/blog/2014/02/php-mvc-framework-tutorial-part-1/">read the previous part of this tutorial</a>.</p>

<h1 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h1>
<p>Have in mind we are actually reinventing the wheel! It’s a common story already,
you see library X, you really like it, but it doesnt quite work as you want to,
you don’t quite like the way it solves X problem, or you think you can do everyone
a favour by doing the “ultimate X library”, it will be easier to use, faster, better,
stronger, etc, most of the time you just end up worsening the initial problem! </p>

<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png" alt="xkcd's view on new standards" /></p>

<p>xkcd’s sums it up pretty nicely, you can replace standard with library, text
editor, or prety much anything.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong! The fact that this happens is not that bad, as some of the
new standards are actually better, for example, I personally believe that
JSON is a win over XML, and so is YAML.</p>

<p>In this case one could argue it’s understandable as we are just doing this as
a learning process, nevertheless I don’t discourage you to try and improve
the framework or even create your own from scratch!</p>

<p>Don’t get dissapointed to create anything new, new things are cool, but have in 
mind it’s not as easy as it seems! </p>

<p>Now with that in mind, let’s start our framework :) </p>

      <p>Understanding MVC and why frameworks solve problems the way they do is sometimes hard, 
and even more if you never really had those problems in the first place!</p>

<p>I’m a pretty stubborn person, I like learning by myself, so most of the time I end up 
looking for those problems, and finding solutions by myself, which enables me to think
understand why and how frameworks such as Symfony or CodeIgniter solve those problems.</p>

<p>The whole purpose of these tutorials is face those problems and find solutions, the
beautiful part is that by the end of the series you will not only understand the basic
of web MVC, but also the most common problems, and have your preferred solutions.</p>
