<p>Hello! I’m Federico Ramirez, a web developer from Argentina with a special love 
for open source, good practices, beautiful designs and cats.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing around with web technologies since I was 15, back when PHP was 
a hype and nobody really knew how to make a maintainable project. Making 
beautiful functional websites is what I love, for that reason I’m always 
interested in the latest design and UX principles.</p>

<p>As the web itself evolved so did I, when the web MVC movement started with Rails, 
I experienced many PHP frameworks such as CodeIgniter and Symfony, I also tried 
several technologies such as the .NET framework, Rails and lately Node.</p>

<p>As Javascript gained popuparity I decided to dig deeper into that language, 
finding out I really enjoy using it, especially the functional part of it. I
have experience with jQuery, jQuery UI and MV* frameworks such as Google’s
Angular.</p>

<p>At 2012 I stopped freelancing and spent one year working full time at Paradigma,
where I was in charge of the web development department. In Paradigma I worked
with .NET, including classic ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server.</p>

<p>Right now I’m studying, and open to freelance work, offering the whole package 
for the modern web needs, be it design work, programmer work, or both.</p>
