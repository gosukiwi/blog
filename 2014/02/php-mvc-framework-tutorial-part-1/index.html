      <p>Understanding MVC and why frameworks solve problems the way they do is sometimes hard, 
and even more if you never really had those problems in the first place!</p>

<p>I’m a pretty stubborn person, I like learning by myself, so most of the time I end up 
looking for those problems, and finding solutions by myself, which enables me to think
understand why and how frameworks such as Symfony or CodeIgniter solve those problems.</p>

<p>The whole purpose of these tutorials is face those problems and find solutions, the
beautiful part is that by the end of the series you will not only understand the basic
of web MVC, but also the most common problems, and have your preferred solutions.</p>

<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I’m <a href="http://gosukiwi.github.com/portfolio">Federico Ramirez</a>, a web developer from Argentina, with passion for Open Source and good practices, and I’ll do my best to
share my understanding of these technologies in an easy and pragmatic way.</p>

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>Before we continue, I’ll assume the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have PHP 5.3+ installed (I’ll test everything on PHP 5.5 though!)</li>
  <li>You have a web server such as Apache or Nginx running and configured</li>
  <li>You have a preferred IDE or Editor, already configured for PHP development</li>
  <li>You know the basics about PHP and Object Oriented Programming</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are pretty generic requirements, pretty much every web developer satisfies them,
if you don’t, <a href="http://www.phptherightway.com/">here’s a good read</a>, you can come back
whenever you are ready, I’ll be here, promise!</p>

<h2 id="mvc-history">MVC History</h2>

<p>With the basics covered, let’s now talk a bit about <strong>MVC</strong>, which stands for 
Model-View-Controller, it’s a software pattern for developing user interfaces, and
believe it or not it’s from the 70’s! It gained massive popularity when it moved from the
desktop to the web, with Rails beeing one of the first and most popular frameworks to
use that pattern and adapt it to web development.</p>

<p>MVC divides your application in three layers, which somehow communicate with each other.</p>

<p>All in all it’s just a way of thinking and organizing your code, <strong>you don’t need a 
framework</strong> to think in an MVC way, nevertheless a framework forces you to do it, and
when many people need to colaborate on a project, having a normalized way of solving
problems is really helpful. Another advantage is it’s easier to mantain, if you see
a bunch of code you wrote 1 year ago, without using a framework or a design pattern,
it can give you quite a headache to try and modify just a little detail!</p>

<p>The advantages of MVC are several, but have in mind it’s not the only design pattern
out there! There are in fact a lot! Like MVP or MVVM, so it’s not likely that MVC is the
ultimate design pattern for the web, but it makes a lot of sense in most use cases,
if you don’t know which one to use, MVC is a good start for sure!</p>

<h2 id="model-view-and-controller">Model View and Controller</h2>
<p>So far I’ve talked quite a lot about MVC but never really get into much detail! 
Before we start, I’d like to say I’ll try to simplify as much as possible and give
short examples, as to not fall into an abstract and hard to digest description.</p>

<p>The M in MVC, stands for <strong>Model</strong>, in theory it’s your data, in practice, the
model “talks” with the database (most of the time MySQL), so it’s fair to say that
the Model is the link between your application and the database.</p>

<p>You see MVC (and software design patterns in general) is all about separation of
concern, working on smaller independant modules is easier and more mantainable than
doing everything in the same place (spaghetti code).</p>

<p>Are you getting a database error? Retrieving something you are not supposed to? Can’t
insert to the database? The problem is in the Model layer! It might not seem much but 
knowing where the problem helps <strong>a lot</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>View</strong> is what the user sees, in this case, an HTML page, which our application
reads and displays as needed.</p>

<p>This is pretty useful to let a designer work on the pages while the developers work
on the functionality, even if the functionality is not there yet, the designer can already work on the views!</p>

<p>Finally the <strong>Controller</strong> is in charge of binding the Model and the View together, for example, you need to display a list of the latest 10 products, it would look something like this</p>

<pre><code>// somewhere inside a controller...
$model = $this-&gt;get('products_model');
$products = $model-&gt;getLatest(10);
return $this-&gt;view('myView.html', array('products' =&gt; $products));
</code></pre>

<p>The controller loads the according model, get’s the required data, and the view 
is in charge of showing it.</p>

<p>We start to get a taste of the separation of concern, and it’s for that very reason 
that the controller should only manipulate data, but it should not specify how
it’s displayed, that’s the view’s concern!</p>

<p>Also, the controller doesn’t care how the model got the data, or whether it used
MySQL, SQLite or a web service, it just knows that <code>getLatest</code> returns the latest
products.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-in-mvc">Thinking in MVC</h2>
<p>It’s important to think the MVC way, don’t worry, it’s actually pretty easy, to emphasize
this concept let me show you an example of what could have been standard PHP code some
years ago, and let’s transform it to MVC (no framework needed!)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
// file: ./app/entries.php

include('config.php'); // this file opens a connection to a mysql server
include('header.php'); // this file is a bunch of html with embedded PHP

// retrieve all entries
$query = mysql_query('SELECT * FROM `entries`);
while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($query)) {
    echo '&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/entry.php?id=' . $row['id'] . '"&gt;' . $row['name'] . '&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;';
}

include('footer.php'); // this file is a bunch of html too!
</code></pre>

<p>The code above might seem easy to read and understand, but it mixes everything onto
one file! What if a designer wants to update the way the entries are shown? Unless he knows PHP and is familiar with the project it’s going to be impossible.
Another problem is, what if we change the table name from <code>entries</code> to <code>my_entries</code>, probably we’ll need to update a bunch of <code>.php</code> files with the new query.</p>

<p>One of the most important points though, is that the code above can’t be easily tested,
MVC and TDD play really well together, and they lead to mantainable and stable software.</p>

<p>In case you wonder what TDD is 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a>, 
I won’t cover TDD in these tutorials but it’s worth mentioning it should be used in
pretty much every software project which will need maintenance and stability.</p>

<p>In MVC you can test the Model, the View and the Controller in different and
contained tests, so you can be sure you’ll never break anything if you modify
old code and the test pass :)</p>

<p>TDD of course has a lot more benefits, it’s worth taking some time and implement it
in your projects.</p>

<p>Enough chit-chat though! Let’s MVCify that code! </p>

<pre><code>// file: ./app/controllers/entries_controller.php
class EntriesController extends BaseController
{
    public function index() {
        $model = $this-&gt;get('entries_model');
        $entries = $model-&gt;getLatest();
        return $this-&gt;view('entries/index.html', array('entries' =&gt; $entries));
    }
}

// file: ./app/models/entries_model.php
class EntriesModel extends BaseModel
{
    public function getLatest() {
        return $this-&gt;query('SELECT * FROM `entries`);
    }
}

// file: ./app/views/entries/index.html.php
&lt;h1&gt;Listing all entries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;?php foreach ($entries as $entry): ?&gt;
    &lt;a href="/delete/&lt;?php echo $entry['id']; ?&gt;"&gt;&lt;?php echo $entry['name'] ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Okay so we split that file onto 3, solving all the problems I said before! 
First of all, let’s look at the controller, it’s just a class which extends from 
<code>BaseController</code>, this is just a class with some shared
methods to not repeat yourself with all controllers, it can have methods such as
<code>get</code> which returns an specified model in this case, and <code>view</code> which
includes and displays a <code>.php</code> file with a given context.</p>

<p>The model is also a class which extends from BaseModel, and as with the controller,
BaseModel eliminates repetition and eases the creation of several models, it also
does some of the work <code>include('config.php')</code> did in the old script. </p>

<p>Finally the view is just a plain HTML file with some embedded PHP, it’s important to
note that the PHP code is used only to display the data sent by the controller as
desired. Using plain PHP might simple for us but it’s not easy for a designer to work with it, and it gives too much power, which can lead to developers adding too much 
logic in the view, instead of where it should be. Templates exist for this reason,
we can just choose a library and use it, with <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a> 
beeing one of the most popular and supported out there, <a href="https://github.com/aheinze/cockpit/blob/master/vendor/Lexy.php">Lexy</a> is also a nice 
alternative.</p>

<p>The previous view in Twig would look something like this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Listing all entries&lt;/h1&gt;
{% for entry in entries %}
    &lt;a href="/delete/{{ entry.id }}"&gt;{{ entry.name }}&lt;/a&gt;
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<p>Much more friendly! And it eliminates possible ugly hacks that should be avoided.</p>

<p>Note that the logic of each of these components is really simple, each layer has one 
responsibility, making it easier to develop!</p>

<p>Ok, so all the components are created, now what? What binds them together? Well
if you had a framework that would just magically work, nevertheless, for now, we can 
just instantiate all classes manually</p>

<pre><code>//file: ./index.php

include('app/controllers/entries_controller.php');

$controller = new EntriesController();
$controller-&gt;index();
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the example won’t work if you copy and paste the given code
as we didn’t create the base clases, you can consider it pseudo-code.</p>

<p>In the following tutorial we’ll get our hands dirty and actually write code
which actually run!</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this first part we saw what MVC is, and some problems it solves, we learnt that
testing is good, also we saw some alternative solutions for displaying views, such as
Twig and Lexy.</p>

<p>I really hope I made myself clear and I’m open to suggestions! Just leave a 
comment below.</p>
