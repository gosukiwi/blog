    <h1>Creating a PHP MVC framework - Part 2</h1>
    <aside>Posted on February 9, 2014</aside>
    <article>
      <p>Hello! And welcome back to the second part of the PHP MVC framework tutorial!
In this part we’ll get our hands dirty with some real code, if you 
haven’t already, you should <a href="http://gosukiwi.github.io/blog/2014/02/php-mvc-framework-tutorial-part-1/">read the previous part of this tutorial</a>.</p>

<h1 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h1>
<p>Have in mind we are actually reinventing the wheel! It’s a common story already,
you see library X, you really like it, but it doesnt quite work as you want to,
you don’t quite like the way it solves X problem, or you think you can do everyone
a favour by doing the “ultimate X library”, it will be easier to use, faster, better,
stronger, etc, most of the time you just end up worsening the initial problem! </p>

<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png" alt="xkcd's view on new standards" /></p>

<p>xkcd’s sums it up pretty nicely, you can replace standard with library, text
editor, or prety much anything.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong! The fact that this happens is not that bad, as some of the
new standards are actually better, for example, I personally believe that
JSON is a win over XML, and so is YAML.</p>

<p>In this case one could argue it’s understandable as we are just doing this as
a learning process, nevertheless I don’t discourage you to try and improve
the framework or even create your own from scratch!</p>

<p>Don’t get dissapointed to create anything new, new things are cool, but have in 
mind it’s not as easy as it seems! </p>

<p>Now with that in mind, let’s start our framework :) </p>

<!-- more -->

<h1 id="directory-structure">Directory Structure</h1>
<p>Let’s start off by defining our directory structure, because PHP uses <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">composer</a>
for dependency management, we’ll create a <code>vendor/</code> folder, all of composer’s
managed dependencies will reside there, as that is composer’s configuration by default. 
Even though we are “reinventing the wheel”, we don’t have to start from scratch! 
There are already some nice libraries we can use to save us some work!</p>

<p>Our application will reside inside <code>app/</code>, as it’s somewhat a standard name
for the main application folder. Inside that folder, we’ll create three more
folders: <code>controllers</code>, <code>models</code>, and <code>views</code>.</p>

<p>The entry point of the framework will be the index.php file.</p>

<p>Our structure so far looks like this</p>

<pre><code>app/
|- controllers/
|- models/
|- views/
vendor/
index.php
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s now proceed to work on the <code>index.php</code> file, as this is the entry point
of your application, it will have to do all the initial setup, for now, we have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Load a controller, and instantiate it</li>
  <li>Call the appropiate function of the controller</li>
</ul>

<p>Which controller should we load? Well here is where the routing concept kicks in,
for now let’s just load the controller and action (the function which will be called)
from reading the URL, this is not very versatile for custom routes, but it’s quite
a good starting point.</p>

<p>So let’s assume our website is hosted at <code>http://localhost/mvc-tutorial</code>, if
we wanted to call the ‘Main’ controller and the ‘index’ method, we should point
our browser to <code>http://localhost/mvc-tutorial/index.php/Main/index</code>, so the
format looks like <code>{base-url}/index.php/{controller}/{action}</code>.</p>

<p>This is what the initial <code>index.php</code> file looks like</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;?php

// This is our framework setup
// The first thing we want to do is load the appropiate controller and call
// the required function.
// There are several ways to accomplish this, for now let's add a formatting
// rule to our URLs, they must be in the following format
//
// http://mysite.com/index.php/{controller_class}/{function_name} 
// 
// Notice the index.php part, we can later remove this by using URL Rewriting.

// The first step is to fetch the requested URI, we can use PHP's $_SERVER array
// to get the REQUEST_URI, which will look something like /index.php/hello/world
$uri = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];

// Make sure the $url always ends with '/'
if(strrpos($uri, '/') + 1 != strlen($uri)) {
    $uri .= '/';
}

// Let's jump straight to after index.php/, as that's the part we are concerned
// about
$route = substr($uri, strpos($uri, 'index.php/') + strlen('index.php/'));

// We can now get the controller and action
// Let's split the string using '/' as a delimiter, the first result is the
// controller, the second is the action
$params = explode('/', $route);
// If no controller is specified, use 'MainController'
$controller = $params[0] ? $params[0] : 'Main';
// If no action is specified, use 'index'
$action = count($params) &gt; 1 ? $params[1] : 'index';

// Now call the according controller
// First, append 'Controller' to the controller name, so we end up with names
// such as 'MainController', 'UsersController', etc.
$controller .= 'Controller';
// This is the path to the controller file
$ctrl_file = __DIR__ . '/app/controllers/' . $controller . '.php';

// If the controller does not exist, throw an exception
if(!file_exists($ctrl_file)) {
    throw new Exception("Controller $controller was not found.");
}

// If the controller does exist, include it and call the action/function
require($ctrl_file);
$ctrl = new $controller;
$ctrl-&gt;$action();
</pre>

<p>That’s quite a lot of code! But don’t worry, it’s not complicated, and it’s mostly
comments, note that we use <code>REQUEST_URI</code> to get the full path, so we can work 
based on that URI, also, all our controllers must end with ‘Controller’, both the
name of the file, and the class name, so the Main controller is a class named 
<code>MainController</code> in a file caleld <code>MainController.php</code>.</p>

<p>Something important to note is that, if no action is specified, it will
default to the <code>index</code> action, something similar happens to the controller,
if nothing is specified in the uri it will default to <code>Main</code>.</p>

<p>If you run the code it will throw an exception, as the <code>MainController.php</code>
file does not exist, let’s fix that by creating the <code>app/controllers/MainController.php</code>
with the following code</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;?php
class MainController
{
    public function index() {
        echo '&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;';
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The controller’s <code>index</code> function just returns a ‘Hello, World!’ message,
if you now run your app, it will work, but it’s not very MVC oriented for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The data, in this case the ‘Hello, World!’ message, is hard-coded into the controller</li>
  <li>The controller not only displays the actual data, but it also says how it should be displayed! (by using the h1 tag), this should be done by the view</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s fix those by</p>

<ul>
  <li>Getting the message from a model, which could fetch it from a database, a webservice or any other resource</li>
  <li>Use a view to format the output</li>
</ul>

<p>That way the controller just binds the model data and sends the data to the view, which displays it accordingly.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;?php
require(__DIR__ . '/../models/GreetingModel.php');

class MainController
{
    public function index() {
        $model = new GreetingModel();
        $greeting = $model-&gt;getGreeting();

        $this-&gt;view('Main/index.html.php', array(
            'greeting' =&gt; $greeting
        ));
    }

    private function view($file, $params = array()) {
        extract($params);
        require(__DIR__ . '/../views/' .$file);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>GreetingModel</code> is just a class with a <code>getGreeting</code> method,
which returns our message, right now we don’t really care if it uses a database,
a web service or whatever resource, once we get the data, we pass it to a view
file, <code>index.html.php</code>, and pass our model data as parameter.</p>

<p>Finally, we add a helper <code>view</code> method which extracts the array keys and
values as variables, setting up a context for the included file, which is actually
included in the next line using <code>require</code>, that file can now access the 
greeting message by just using the <code>$greeting</code> variable.</p>

<p>For the sake of completeness, I’ll include the <code>GreetingModel</code> source code</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;?php
class GreetingModel
{
    public function getGreeting() {
        return 'Hello, World!';
    }
}
</pre>

<p>And also the <code>index.html.php</code> file.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />    &lt;head&gt;<br />        &lt;title&gt;Example View&lt;/title&gt;<br />    &lt;/head&gt;<br />    &lt;body&gt;<br />        &lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php echo $greeting; ?&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;<br />    &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;<br />
</pre>

<p>Our folder structure is now</p>

<pre><code>app/
    controllers/
        MainController.php
    models/
        GreetingModel.php
    views/
        Main/
            index.html.php
vendor/
index.php
</code></pre>

<p>The following chart explains the flow of the application, which also describes
the web MVC design pattern</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/mvc-flowchart.png" alt="Flow chart" /></p>

<p>As you can see, the first thing the app does when it gets a request from
the browser is call index.php, this file sets up the according controller
and calls the required action, then the controller uses the model (this step is optional),
and finally returns a view, which is what the browser gets as response (this is also 
optional as redirection is handled by the controller).</p>

<p>If you have any error with your code or just want to download the full source code, 
you can check the git repository at <a href="https://github.com/gosukiwi/php-mvc-tutorial">GitHub</a>. 
The repository uses tags as a way to go backward and forward in time, the repository for this
tutorial is <code>v1</code>, for part 3 it will be <code>v2</code> and so on.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>So far we have created a simple MVC folder structure and worked on the 
entry point of our application, the <code>index.php</code> file, controllers, 
models and views are really simple, in fact, the controller and the model are just common PHP classes, and
the view is just an html file with embedded PHP, but it hopefully demonstrate
the concept that you don’t really need a fully featured framework to take advantage
of a design pattern, in this case, web MVC.</p>

<p>We’ll also demonstrate later on why frameworks are so awesome, and
all the things they ease for us, like base classes, helpers/libraries, dependency
injection, and such.</p>
